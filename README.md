# Optical RL-Gym

[OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) is the de-facto interface for reinforcement learning environments.
Optical RL-Gym builds on top of OpenAI Gym's interfaces to create a set of environments that model optical network problems such as resource management and reconfiguration.
Optical RL-Gym can be used to quickly start experimenting with reinforcement learning in optical network problems.
Later, you can use the pre-defined environments to create more specific environments for your particular use case.

Please use the following bibtex:

}
```

The authors' version is available [here](https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/523623).

## Features

Across all the environments, the following features are available:

- Use of [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) for the topology graph representation, resource and path computation.
- Uniform and non-uniform traffic generation.
- Flag to let agents proactively reject requests or not.
- Appropriate random number generation with seed management providing reproducibility of results.

<a href="#installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>

This tool uses the Gym version 0.21. For compatibility reasons, we use Python version 3.9.
Here are the recommended steps to install the tool (as of April 2024):

1. Download the repository in your machine. To do this, open the terminal and go to the folder where you want to have the tool downloaded. Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carlosnatalino/optical-rl-gym.git
cd optical-rl-gym
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3.9 -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install legacy versions of `setuptools` and `pip` (more info about why we need this available in [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77124879/pip-extras-require-must-be-a-dictionary-whose-values-are-strings-or-lists-of)):

```bash
pip install setuptools==65.5.0 pip==21
```

5. Now you can install the Optical RL-Gym with:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
``` 

You will be able to run the [examples](#examples) right away.

You can see the dependencies in the [setup.py](setup.py) file.

**To traing reinforcement learning agents, you must create or install reinforcement learning agents. Here are some of the libraries containing RL agents:**
- [Stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/)
- [TensorFlow Agents](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents)
- [ChainerRL](https://github.com/chainer/chainerrl)
- [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines) -- in maintenance mode

<a href="#environments"><h2>Environments</h2></a>

At this moment, the following environments are ready for use:

1. RWAEnv
2. RMSAEnv
3. DeepRMSA

More environments will be added in the near future.

<a href="#examples"><h2>Examples</h2></a>

Training a RL agent for one of the Optical RL-Gym environments can be done with a few lines of code.

For instance, you can use a [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) agent trained for the RMSA environment:

```python
# define the parameters of the RMSA environment
env_args = dict(topology=topology, seed=10, allow_rejection=False, 
                load=50, episode_length=50)
# create the environment
env = gym.make('RMSA-v0', **env_args)
# create the agent
agent = PPO2(MlpPolicy, env)
# run 10k learning timesteps
agent.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
```

We provide a set of [examples](./examples).
