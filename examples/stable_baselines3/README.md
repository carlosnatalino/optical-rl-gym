# Optical RL-Gym

In this folder, you will find a few examples of how to use the Optical RL-Gym in combination with Stable Baselines 3 agents.

Before running the examples, make sure to install the Optical RL-Gym and the Stable Baselines 3 in your Python environment.

This code should run using Python 3.8 or Python 3.9.

Note that the OpenAI Gym package might output some errors during installation, but should work fine.

Alternatively, you can run

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
